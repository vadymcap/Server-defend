## How to Play

### Objective

Survive as long as possible! Manage your **Budget ($)**, **Reputation (%)**, and **Service Health**.

- **Earn Money** by successfully processing legitimate traffic requests.
- **Lose Reputation** if requests fail or if malicious traffic slips through.
- **Maintain Health** - Services degrade under load and need repairs.
- **Game Over** if Reputation hits 0% or you go bankrupt ($-1000).

### Traffic Types

| **MALICIOUS** | Red    | Blocked by Firewall| $0     | DDoS attacks — block with Firewall!    |

### Infrastructure & Services

Build your architecture using the toolbar. Each service has a cost, capacity, and upkeep:

| Service          | Cost | Capacity  | Upkeep    | Function                                                              |
| :--------------- | :--- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firewall**     | $40  | 30        | Low       | **Security.** First line of defense. Blocks malicious traffic.        |
| **API Gateway**  | $70  | 40        | Medium    | **Rate Limiting.** Throttles excess traffic (soft-fail). **Upgradeable T1→T3.** |
| **Queue**        | $45  | Queue:200 | Low       | **Buffer.** Buffers requests during spikes. Prevents drops.           |
| **Load Balancer**| $50  | 20        | Medium    | **Distribution.** Distributes traffic to multiple instances.          |
| **Compute**      | $60  | 4         | High      | **Processing.** Processes requests. **Upgradeable T1→T3.**            |
| **CDN**          | $60  | 50        | Low       | **Delivery.** Caches STATIC content at edge (95% hit rate).           |
| **SQL DB**       | $150 | 8         | Very High | **Database.** Handles READ/WRITE/SEARCH. **Upgradeable T1→T3.**      |
| **NoSQL DB**     | $80  | 15        | High      | **Fast Database.** Handles READ/WRITE only (no SEARCH). **Upgradeable T1→T3.** |
| **Cache**        | $60  | 30        | Medium    | **Caching.** Caches responses to reduce DB load. **Upgradeable T1→T3.** |
| **Storage**      | $25  | 25        | Low       | **File System.** Destination for STATIC/UPLOAD traffic.               |

### Upkeep & Cost Scaling

- **Base Upkeep:** Each service has per-minute upkeep costs
- **Upkeep Scaling:** Costs increase 1x to 2x over 10 minutes
- **Repair Costs:** 15% of service cost to manually repair
- **Auto-Repair:** +10% upkeep overhead when enabled

### Game Modes

#### Survival Mode

The core experience - survive as long as possible against escalating traffic with constant intervention required:

**Dynamic Challenges:**

- **RPS Acceleration** - Traffic multiplies at time milestones (×1.3 at 1min → ×4.0 at 10min)
- **Random Events** - Cost spikes, capacity drops, traffic bursts every 15-45 seconds
- **Traffic Shifts** - Traffic patterns change every 40 seconds
- **DDoS Spikes** - 50% malicious traffic waves every 45 seconds
- **Service Degradation** - Services lose health under load, require repairs

**New UI Features:**

- **Health bars on all services**
- **Active event indicator bar at top**
- **Detailed finances panel (income/expenses breakdown)**
- **Service health panel with repair costs**
- **Auto-repair toggle**
- **Game over analysis with tips**

#### Sandbox Mode

A fully customizable testing environment for experimenting with any architecture:

| Control           | Description                                                       |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Budget**        | Set any starting budget (slider 0-10K, or type any amount)        |
| **RPS**           | Control traffic rate (0 = stopped, or type 100+ for stress tests) |
| **Traffic Mix**   | Adjust all 6 traffic type percentages independently               |
| **Burst**         | Spawn instant bursts of specific traffic types                    |
| **Upkeep Toggle** | Enable/disable service costs                                      |
| **Clear All**     | Reset all services and restore budget                             |

**No game over in Sandbox** - experiment freely!

- **Time Controls:** Pause, Play (1x), and Fast Forward (3x).

## Strategy Tips

1.  **Block Attacks First:** Always place a Firewall immediately connected to the Internet. Malicious leaks destroy reputation fast (-5 per leak).
2.  **Use CDN for Static Content:** Connect Internet -> CDN -> Storage. The CDN handles 95% of static traffic cheaply!
3.  **Watch Service Health:** Damaged services have reduced capacity. Click to repair or enable Auto-Repair.
4.  **Scale for Traffic Surges:** RPS multiplies at milestones - prepare before ×2.0 at 3 minutes!
5.  **Balance Income vs Upkeep:** Start lean, scale as income grows. Over-provisioning leads to bankruptcy.
6.  **Use Cache Wisely:** Reduces database load significantly for READ requests.
7.  **Buffer with Queue:** Queue helps survive traffic burst events without dropping requests.
8.  **React to Events:** Watch the event bar - cost spikes mean hold off on purchases, traffic bursts mean ensure capacity.
9.  **API Gateway for Graceful Degradation:** Throttled requests only lose -0.2 reputation (vs -1.0 for failures). Great for surviving traffic spikes!
10. **Split DB Traffic with NoSQL:** Route READ/WRITE to NoSQL (faster, cheaper) and keep SQL DB for SEARCH queries only.

## Tech Stack
